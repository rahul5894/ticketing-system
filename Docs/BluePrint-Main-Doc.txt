## ✅ Core Principles Maintained

| Principle              | Applied How?                                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain-Driven**      | Features grouped by business logic (`ticketing`, `auth`, etc.)  |
| **DRY**                | Shared code in `shared/`, stores, utilities, Zod schemas reused |
| **SOLID**              | Domain services/components separated, single responsibility     |
| **YAGNI**              | No abstraction unless necessary, simple stores, hooks, services |
| **No Overengineering** | No unnecessary files or layering, minimal boilerplate           |

## 🧠 How to Scale Later

* Add new folders under `domains/` (e.g., `billing/`, `chat/`, `notifications/`) with the same pattern.
* Easily refactor services into microservices later if needed — each domain is self-contained.
* Plug in AI (already scaffolded).
* Move backend logic to Supabase Edge Functions when heavier logic appears.

This is a **2025-standard modern monolithic structure** that balances beginner-friendliness, performance, and future scalability.
