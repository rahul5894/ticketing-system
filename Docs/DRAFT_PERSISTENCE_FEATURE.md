# Draft Persistence Feature

## Overview

The Create New Ticket form now includes draft persistence functionality that automatically saves form data as users type, allowing them to navigate between creating tickets and viewing recent tickets without losing their work.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Draft Saving
- Form data is automatically saved to localStorage as users type
- Debounced saving (500ms delay) to avoid excessive writes
- Only saves when form contains meaningful data (title, description, or cc fields)
- Attachments are not persisted (File objects cannot be serialized)

### 2. Draft Loading
- When users return to the Create New Ticket form, their draft is automatically loaded
- Form fields are populated with previously entered data
- Priority and department selections are restored

### 3. Discard/Clear Button
- New "Discard" button added next to the "Create Ticket" button
- Clears all form fields and resets to initial empty state
- Removes draft from localStorage
- Uses outline variant styling with Trash2 icon

### 4. Updated Button Styling
- Both "Create Ticket" and "Create New Ticket" buttons now use ShadCN UI default theming
- Automatically adapts to light/dark mode:
  - Light mode: Black buttons with white text
  - Dark mode: White buttons with black text
- Removed custom blue styling for consistency

## Technical Implementation

### Draft Persistence Hook
- `useDraftPersistence.ts` - Custom hook managing localStorage operations
- Handles loading, saving, and clearing of draft data
- Includes error handling for localStorage failures
- Type-safe with proper TypeScript interfaces

### Form Integration
- Integrated with react-hook-form using `watch()` for change detection
- Automatic draft clearing on successful form submission
- Manual draft clearing via Discard button

### Storage Structure
```typescript
interface TicketDraft {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  priority: TicketPriority;
  department: Department;
  assignedTo: string[];
  cc?: string | undefined;
}
```

## User Experience

### Navigation Flow
1. User starts filling out Create New Ticket form
2. User navigates to view a Recent Ticket → draft is automatically saved
3. User returns to Create New Ticket → draft is automatically loaded
4. User can continue editing or click "Discard" to start fresh
5. When form is submitted successfully → draft is automatically cleared

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of localStorage unavailability (private browsing)
- JSON parsing error protection
- Console warnings for debugging without breaking functionality
