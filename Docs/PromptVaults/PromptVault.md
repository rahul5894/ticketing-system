I want you to conduct a comprehensive performance audit and optimization of the surgeries page files. This is our core page that the entire application depends on, so it must be optimized to peak performance.

**Specific Requirements:**

1. **Performance Audit & Research:**

   - Use vertex-ai-mcp-server to research the latest 2025 performance optimization techniques for React, TypeScript, TanStack Table, React Query, and Supabase
   - Use sequential-thinking to systematically analyze each file in the surgeries implementation
   - Use context7 to get the most up-to-date documentation for our tech stack
   - Identify any performance bottlenecks, unnecessary complexity, or outdated patterns

2. **Optimization Targets:**

   - Eliminate any remaining performance violations or slow handlers
   - Optimize React re-renders and component memoization
   - Improve data fetching and caching strategies
   - Streamline state management across Zustand, React Query, and IndexedDB
   - Optimize TanStack Table performance for large datasets
   - Enhance Supabase realtime performance

3. **Code Quality Improvements:**

   - Simplify complex code into fewer, more effective lines
   - Remove any over-engineered solutions
   - Apply YAGNI, SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles
   - Ensure type safety and eliminate any remaining TypeScript issues
   - Update to latest best practices for our tech stack

4. **Constraints:**

   - Prioritize improving existing code structure over creating new files
   - Only create new files if absolutely necessary
   - Maintain current functionality while improving performance
   - Focus on simplicity, clarity, and maintainable solutions

5. **Process:**
   - First, use taskmanager to create a structured plan showing what optimizations you'll implement
   - Research latest techniques using vertex-ai-mcp-server
   - Present the optimization plan before implementation
   - Focus on maximum impact with minimal code changes

**Goal:** Achieve top-notch, blazing-fast performance with clean, maintainable code in few lines that follows 2025 best practices.

---

1. **Clean Up Legacy Code**: Thoroughly remove all old approach code and prevent conflicts:

   - Remove any leftover code from the original monolithic surgeries-table.tsx implementation
   - Clean up unused imports, variables, and functions
   - Ensure no duplicate or conflicting code paths exist
   - Remove any temporary fixes or workarounds that are no longer needed

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure no TypeScript errors or warnings
   - Verify all ESLint rules are followed
   - Confirm proper component composition and hook usage
   - Validate that the new architecture maintains all existing functionality

I've observed a rare but recurring UI issue with the status dropdown in the surgeries table. When I click on a status dropdown very quickly (rapid open/close actions), sometimes the dropdown behavior becomes erratic - it may flicker, not respond properly, or require multiple clicks to function correctly. This issue is intermittent but noticeable.

Please investigate this status dropdown interaction issue and determine the root cause:

1. **Investigate potential causes:**

   - Check if table rows (td elements) are re-rendering unnecessarily during status interactions
   - Examine if there are race conditions in state updates or event handlers
   - Look for memory leaks or performance bottlenecks in the dropdown component
   - Verify if React keys are properly set to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Check for conflicting event listeners or duplicate event handling

2. **Performance analysis:**

   - Analyze the component render cycle during rapid status changes
   - Check for expensive operations in useEffect hooks or event handlers
   - Verify proper memoization of dropdown components and callbacks
   - Ensure efficient state management without unnecessary re-renders

3. **Optimization requirements:**

   - Implement proper debouncing/throttling for rapid user interactions
   - Optimize component re-rendering using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where appropriate
   - Ensure stable references for event handlers and dropdown options
   - Fix any identified performance bottlenecks or race conditions

4. **Solution guidelines:**

   - Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering
   - Apply YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), SOLID, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
   - Focus on the specific issue without introducing unrelated changes
   - Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality

5. **Testing and verification:**
   - Test rapid clicking scenarios to reproduce and verify the fix
   - Ensure smooth dropdown behavior under normal and stress conditions
   - Verify no performance regressions in the surgeries table

Please provide a detailed analysis of the issue and implement a targeted fix that maintains code quality and performance standards.

Performance: Reduced unnecessary re-renders and API call

I need you to perform a comprehensive investigation and debugging of the surgeries page using available tools. There are critical data synchronization issues that need to be resolved:

**Current Issues Identified:**

1. **Data Mismatch**: Supabase database contains 2 surgeries, but the surgery table displays different surgeries that don't exist in Supabase
2. **Add Operation Failure**: New surgeries are saved to Supabase but don't appear in the UI table
3. **Delete Operation Issues**: Deleting surgeries from the table causes them to reappear after deletion
4. **Status Update Problems**: Status changes revert back and show errors after confirmation

**Investigation Requirements:**

1. **Use Playwright Browser Testing**: Navigate to the surgeries page and test all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. **Database Verification**: Use Supabase MCP tool to verify actual database contents (READ-ONLY access only)
3. **Data Flow Analysis**: Trace where the incorrect surgery data is coming from (IndexedDB cache, Zustand store, or other sources)
4. **Real-time Sync Testing**: Test real-time synchronization between database and UI

**Tools to Use:**

- **Playwright**: For browser automation and UI testing
- **Supabase MCP**: For database inspection (READ-ONLY operations only)
- **Context7**: For latest documentation and technical methods
- **Sequential Thinking**: For systematic problem analysis and solution refinement

**Testing Scenarios:**

1. Load the surgeries page and verify displayed data matches Supabase
2. Add a new surgery and confirm it appears in both database and UI
3. Update surgery status and verify persistence
4. Delete a surgery and confirm it's removed from both database and UI
5. Test real-time updates across multiple browser sessions

**Code Quality Requirements:**

- Follow DRY, YAGNI, SOLID, and KISS principles
- Eliminate any unnecessary complexity or over-engineering
- Minimize API calls and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Ensure optimal performance with minimal resource usage

**Expected Deliverables:**

1. Root cause analysis of the data synchronization issues
2. Step-by-step reproduction of the problems
3. Specific fixes for each identified issue
4. Verification that all CRUD operations work correctly
5. Confirmation that the implementation follows the established architecture patterns

**Critical Note**: Do not modify or delete any data in Supabase - use READ-ONLY access only for investigation purposes.
