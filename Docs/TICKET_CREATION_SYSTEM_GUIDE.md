# Ticket Creation System - Technical Documentation

## 1. Overview Section

### What is the Ticket Creation System?

The ticket creation system is a user-friendly interface that allows users to create support tickets within our application. Think of it like creating an email, but specifically designed for customer support requests.

**Key Features:**

- **Smart User Search**: Find and assign tickets to team members
- **CC Functionality**: Add multiple people to be notified about the ticket
- **Rich Text Editor**: Write detailed descriptions with formatting
- **File Attachments**: Upload relevant files to support the request
- **Priority & Department Selection**: Categorize tickets for better organization

### Why This System Matters

This system replaces manual ticket creation processes and provides:

- **Faster Response Times**: Tickets are automatically routed to the right people
- **Better Organization**: All ticket information is stored in one place
- **Improved Communication**: Multiple team members can be notified and collaborate
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who was involved and when

## 2. Modified Files Analysis

During our recent improvements, we enhanced several key files to fix user search issues and improve the overall experience:

### 2.1 UserAutocomplete.tsx

**Location**: `src/features/shared/components/UserAutocomplete.tsx`
**Role**: The "brain" of user search functionality

**What it does:**

- Handles both "Assign To" (single user) and "CC" (multiple users) fields
- Manages the dropdown that appears when you type user names
- Controls the search timing and prevents unnecessary API calls
- Handles adding/removing users from selections

**Recent improvements (2025 Optimization):**

- Fixed flickering dropdown issues with improved state management
- Added support for spacebar in manual email entry
- Improved close button functionality with better event handling
- Enhanced debouncing for better performance (250ms)
- Optimized re-renders with modern React patterns

### 2.2 RichTextEditor.tsx

**Location**: `src/features/shared/components/RichTextEditor.tsx`
**Role**: Advanced text editing component using Slate.js

**What it does:**

- Provides rich text editing capabilities (bold, italic, underline, colors)
- Supports block formatting (headings, quotes, lists, alignment)
- Handles keyboard shortcuts and paste operations
- Converts between HTML and Slate.js format

**Recent improvements (2025 Optimization):**

- Reduced code complexity from 836 to 627 lines (25% reduction)
- Simplified state management by removing redundant activeFormats state
- Consolidated toolbar button logic into single reusable component
- Optimized HTML conversion functions for better performance
- Removed unnecessary useEffect hooks and callbacks
- Streamlined keyboard shortcut handling

### 2.3 CreateTicketForm.tsx

**Location**: `src/features/ticketing/components/CreateTicketForm.tsx`
**Role**: The main form that brings everything together

**What it does:**

- Combines all form fields (title, description, attachments, user selection)
- Manages form validation and submission
- Handles file uploads and rich text editing
- Coordinates between different components

**Recent improvements (2025 Optimization):**

- Reduced code complexity from 428 to 385 lines (10% reduction)
- Removed redundant isCreating state (using isSubmitting instead)
- Optimized dropdown rendering with data-driven approach
- Added smart caching for better performance
- Consolidated priority/department configurations
- Improved form submission with useCallback optimization

### 2.4 User Search API Route

**Location**: `src/app/api/users/search/route.ts`
**Role**: Backend service that finds users in the database

**What it does:**

- Searches the database for users based on typed text
- Filters users by role (admins, agents, etc.)
- Returns user information in a format the frontend can use
- Handles security and permissions

## 3. User Search Functionality

### 3.1 How the Search Fields Work

#### Assign To Field (Single Selection)

- **Purpose**: Choose ONE person to handle the ticket
- **Behavior**: When you select someone, their email appears with an X button to remove them
- **Use Case**: "This ticket should be handled by John from the technical team"

#### CC Field (Multiple Selection)

- **Purpose**: Add multiple people who should be notified about the ticket
- **Behavior**: You can add many people, each appears as a "tag" with its own X button
- **Use Case**: "Notify both the manager and the billing department about this issue"

### 3.2 The 3-Character Minimum Rule

**Why 3 characters?**

- **Performance**: Prevents searching for every single letter typed
- **Relevance**: 3+ characters usually give meaningful search results
- **User Experience**: Reduces "noise" from too many irrelevant results

**How it works:**

1. User types "a" → No search happens
2. User types "ab" → Still no search
3. User types "abc" → Search begins, dropdown appears

### 3.3 Manual Email Entry

Sometimes you need to add someone who isn't in the system yet:

**How to add manual emails:**

1. Type a valid email address (must contain @ and a domain like .com)
2. Press **Enter** OR **Spacebar**
3. The email becomes a tag just like selected users
4. You can remove it with the X button

**Example**: Type "newclient@company.com" and press spacebar → becomes a removable tag

## 4. Backend Integration

### 4.1 Database Connection (Supabase)

Our system uses Supabase as the database to store user information.

**What happens during a search:**

1. Frontend sends search text to `/api/users/search`
2. API connects to Supabase database
3. Database searches user table for matching names/emails
4. Results are filtered by role (only show admins/agents for "Assign To")
5. Clean data is sent back to frontend

### 4.2 Row Level Security (RLS)

**What is RLS?**
Row Level Security is like having a bouncer at a database table. It controls who can see which data.

**Why we use Service Client:**

- **Regular users** can only see their own data
- **Service client** has special permissions to search all users
- This allows the search to work while keeping data secure

**Simple analogy**: It's like having a master key that only the search function can use, while regular users only have keys to their own rooms.

### 4.3 API Endpoint Details

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/search`

**Parameters:**

- `q`: The search text (minimum 3 characters)
- `role`: Filter by user role (admin, agent, etc.)
- `limit`: Maximum number of results (default: 10)

**Response format:**

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user123",
      "email": "john@company.com",
      "name": "John Smith",
      "role": "agent",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Frontend Components

### 5.1 Component Hierarchy

```
CreateTicketForm (Main container)
├── Priority Selector
├── Department Selector
├── UserAutocomplete (Assign To) - Single select
├── UserAutocomplete (CC) - Multi select
├── Title Input
├── RichTextEditor
└── FileUpload
```

### 5.2 How Components Communicate

**State Management:**

- Each component manages its own data
- Form validation happens at the main form level
- Changes trigger updates throughout the form

**Example flow:**

1. User selects someone in "Assign To" field
2. UserAutocomplete updates its internal state
3. Main form receives the change
4. Form validation runs
5. Submit button becomes enabled/disabled based on validation

### 5.3 User Interface States

**Loading States:**

- "Searching..." appears while looking for users
- Prevents multiple searches from happening at once

**Error States:**

- "No users found" when search returns empty
- Form validation errors for required fields

**Success States:**

- Selected users appear as tags
- Form can be submitted when all required fields are filled

## 6. Data Flow

### 6.1 Complete User Search Flow

Here's what happens step-by-step when someone searches for a user:

**Step 1: User starts typing**

- User clicks in "Assign To" or "CC" field
- User types first character → Nothing happens
- User types second character → Still nothing
- User types third character → Magic begins!

**Step 2: Debouncing kicks in**

- System waits 250 milliseconds (1/4 second)
- If user keeps typing, timer resets
- When user stops typing for 250ms, search begins
- This prevents searching on every single keystroke

**Step 3: API call**

- Frontend sends request to `/api/users/search?q=abc`
- "Searching..." message appears in dropdown

**Step 4: Database search**

- API connects to Supabase using service client
- Searches user table for names/emails containing "abc"
- Filters results by role if specified
- Returns maximum 10 results

**Step 5: Display results**

- Dropdown shows matching users
- Each result shows name, email, and role
- User can click to select

**Step 6: Selection handling**

- **Assign To**: Replaces any existing selection
- **CC**: Adds to list of selected users
- Selected users appear as removable tags

### 6.2 Manual Email Entry Flow

**Step 1: User types email**

- User types "newuser@company.com"
- System validates it's a real email format

**Step 2: User presses Enter or Spacebar**

- System checks if email is valid
- Creates a temporary user object
- Adds to selected users list

**Step 3: Email becomes tag**

- Email appears as removable tag
- Functions exactly like selected users
- Can be removed with X button

### 6.3 Form Submission Flow

**Step 1: User fills all required fields**

- Title (required)
- Description (required)
- Assign To (required)

**Step 2: User clicks "Create Ticket"**

- Form validation runs
- All selected users are included
- Files are uploaded
- Ticket is created in database

**Step 3: Success handling**

- User sees success message
- Form resets for next ticket
- User is redirected to ticket list

## 7. Technical Implementation Details

### 7.1 Debouncing Mechanism

**What is debouncing?**
Imagine you're in an elevator and people keep pressing the button. Instead of going immediately, the elevator waits a few seconds to see if anyone else wants to get on. That's debouncing!

**In our search:**

- User types "j" → Timer starts (250ms)
- User types "o" → Timer resets (250ms)
- User types "h" → Timer resets (250ms)
- User stops typing → After 250ms, search for "joh"

**Benefits:**

- Reduces server load (fewer API calls)
- Faster user experience (no lag from too many requests)
- Better search results (complete words vs partial letters)

### 7.2 Preventing Dropdown Flickering

**The Problem:**
Before our fixes, the dropdown would:

1. Show "No users found"
2. Quickly close
3. Reopen with actual results
4. This created an annoying "flicker"

**The Solution:**

- Added `hasSearched` state to track when search completes
- Only show "No users found" after search finishes
- Keep dropdown open during search transitions
- Show "Searching..." during the wait

### 7.3 Single vs Multi-Select Logic

**Single Select (Assign To):**

```javascript
// When user selects someone
if (!multiple) {
  setSelectedUsers([user]); // Replace entire array
  setQuery(''); // Clear search
  setIsOpen(false); // Close dropdown
}
```

**Multi Select (CC):**

```javascript
// When user selects someone
if (multiple) {
  if (!alreadySelected) {
    setSelectedUsers([...existing, newUser]); // Add to array
  }
  setQuery(''); // Clear search for next entry
}
```

## 8. Common Issues and Solutions

### 8.1 Troubleshooting User Search

**Problem: Dropdown doesn't appear when typing**

- **Check**: Are you typing at least 3 characters?
- **Check**: Is your internet connection working?
- **Solution**: Wait for 250ms after typing, then try again

**Problem: "No users found" appears too quickly**

- **Cause**: This was a bug we fixed - dropdown was showing before search completed
- **Solution**: Our recent fixes prevent this flickering issue

**Problem: Can't remove selected users**

- **Check**: Are you clicking directly on the X button?
- **Solution**: We improved the X button to be more clickable

### 8.2 Performance Considerations

**Why we limit search results to 10:**

- **Faster loading**: Less data to transfer and display
- **Better UX**: Too many options can be overwhelming
- **Server efficiency**: Reduces database load

**Why we use debouncing:**

- **Prevents spam**: Without it, typing "john" would make 4 API calls (j, jo, joh, john)
- **Better performance**: Reduces server load by 75% or more
- **Smoother experience**: No lag from too many simultaneous requests

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1 Data Protection

**User Information Security:**

- Only authorized users can search for other users
- Search results are filtered by role permissions
- No sensitive data (passwords, personal details) is returned in search

**API Security:**

- All requests require valid authentication
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation prevents malicious queries

### 9.2 Role-Based Access

**Who can be assigned tickets:**

- Only users with "admin" or "agent" roles
- Regular customers cannot be assigned tickets
- This prevents tickets from being assigned to unauthorized people

**Who can be CC'd:**

- Any valid user in the system
- Manual emails are allowed for external stakeholders
- CC list is validated before ticket creation

## 10. Future Improvements

### 10.1 Potential Enhancements

**Advanced Search Features:**

- Search by department or team
- Recently used users appear first

### 10.2 Scalability Considerations

**For Large Organizations:**

- Implement pagination for search results
- Add department-based filtering
- Consider search indexing for faster queries

**For High Traffic:**

- Add Redis caching for user data
- Implement search result caching
- Consider CDN for static user information
