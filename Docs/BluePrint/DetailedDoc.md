# DetailedDoc — Part 1: Architecture & Technology Stack with Tenant Isolation & Hybrid Sync

---

## 1. Introduction to Architecture

Your ticketing system is designed as a **Domain-Driven Modular Monolith** that fully supports **multi-tenancy with strict tenant data isolation**:

- The entire system is deployed as a **single monolithic app** internally organized into independent **domains** such as `auth`, `ticketing`, `notifications`, `teams`, and `audit`.
- Each domain contains UI components, business logic, and tenant-aware state management (e.g., Zustand stores).
- This modular design fosters maintainability, scalability, and allows teams to independently develop and extend functionality.
- Tenant isolation is embedded deeply into the architecture, from UI to database layers.

---

## 2. Tenant-Based Multi-Tenancy Overview

- The system supports **true multi-tenancy**, serving thousands of tenants simultaneously on shared infrastructure.
- Each tenant corresponds to a distinct organization or client with **complete logical data isolation**.
- A **shared schema multi-tenancy model** is employed: all tenant data resides in the same database schema but is logically partitioned using a `tenant_id` column.
- Tenant isolation is enforced both in the **application layer** and in the **database layer** via Supabase Row Level Security (RLS).

---

## 3. Tenant Isolation Strategy and Data Security

### 3.1 Tenant Identifier

- Every table containing tenant-specific data includes a **mandatory `tenant_id` UUID** column linking each record to its tenant.

### 3.2 Tenant Scope in Tables

| Table        | Tenant Column | Description                    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `users`      | `tenant_id`   | Tenant owning the user         |
| `tickets`    | `tenant_id`   | Tenant owning the ticket       |
| `responses`  | `tenant_id`   | Tenant owning ticket responses |
| `audit_logs` | `tenant_id`   | Tenant owning audit records    |
| `teams`      | `tenant_id`   | Tenant owning support teams    |

### 3.3 Row Level Security (RLS)

- Supabase PostgreSQL RLS policies ensure data access is limited to rows where `tenant_id` matches the current authenticated user's tenant ID extracted from JWT claims.
- Example RLS policy snippet:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Tenant row access" ON tickets
USING (tenant_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claim.tenant_id')::uuid);
```

- JWT tokens issued at login include the `tenant_id` claim, enabling the DB to enforce strict isolation even if application layer checks are bypassed.

---

## 4. Authentication and Tenant Context

- Authentication is handled by **Clerk**, which manages user sign-up, sign-in, and session lifecycle.
- Upon user login, the system synchronizes Clerk user data with the `users` table in Supabase, associating users with tenants.
- Clerk issues JWT tokens embedding `tenant_id`, `user_id`, and `role` claims.
- All client-server communication includes these tokens to enable tenant-aware authorization.

---

## 5. Application Data Flow with Tenant Awareness

- After login, the frontend stores tenant-aware user information securely.
- API calls and Next.js server actions carry JWT tokens embedding tenant context.
- Backend extracts the `tenant_id` claim and enforces tenant-scoped queries and mutations.
- Client state management (via Zustand) is scoped by tenant to hold isolated user and ticket data.
- Supabase realtime subscriptions are filtered by tenant via RLS, pushing updates only relevant to the active tenant.

---

## 6. Technology Stack Roles (Tenant-Aware)

| Technology           | Role with Tenant Awareness                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Next.js 15.3.4**   | Frontend and backend server actions implement tenant-aware routing and APIs |
| **React 19.1.0**     | UI rendering of tenant-scoped data reactively                               |
| **Clerk**            | Authentication and tenant-bound user identity management                    |
| **Supabase 2.50.0**  | Database with RLS enforcing tenant isolation and realtime subscriptions     |
| **Zustand 5.x**      | Tenant-scoped client state management                                       |
| **Dexie.js 4.x**     | IndexedDB persistent client caching with tenant scoping and delta sync      |
| **Zod 3.x**          | Tenant-aware input validation                                               |
| **Tailwind CSS 4.x** | Consistent, utility-first styling across tenants                            |
| **ShadCN UI**        | Accessible, prebuilt UI components                                          |

---

## 7. Hybrid Client Sync Strategy with Dexie.js and Supabase Realtime

- **Local-First Data Loading:** The client immediately loads tenant-scoped tickets, responses, and user data from **Dexie.js IndexedDB** for instant UI responsiveness.
- **Realtime Updates:** Subscriptions to Supabase realtime channels scoped by tenant push incremental data changes (inserts, updates, deletes) directly to the client.
- **Server Fallback for Completeness:** When the local cache cannot fully satisfy queries or filtering, the client asynchronously fetches missing or updated data pages from backend APIs or Next.js server actions.
- **Incremental Merge and Cache Update:** Incoming server data merges into Dexie and Zustand stores without blocking UI rendering, ensuring smooth UX.
- **Optimistic UI:** Client-side changes are reflected immediately in Zustand and Dexie with asynchronous backend syncing and rollback on failure.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Offline edits and sync conflicts are resolved using last-write-wins or tenant-specific conflict policies, with user notifications on discrepancies.
- **Cache Management:** Dexie indexes tenant_id and other frequently queried fields for fast local queries; cache is cleared or reset on tenant change or logout.

---

## 8. Advantages of This Architecture

- **Instant UI responsiveness** with local caching and real-time updates.
- **Offline-first support** allowing uninterrupted work and background syncing.
- **Strict security and tenant isolation** enforced at multiple layers.
- **Scalable and maintainable modular monolith** with clear domain separation.
- **Extensible foundation** for future AI modules, notifications, and workflow enhancements.

---

## 9. Next Steps

---

# DetailedDoc — Part 2: Authentication & Tenant-Aware User Management

---

## 1. Authentication with Clerk

- Use **Clerk** for secure, full-featured user authentication including sign-up, sign-in, password reset, and session management.
- Clerk issues **JWT tokens** embedding essential claims such as `user_id`, `tenant_id`, and `role` that establish user identity and tenant context.
- These tokens are included with all backend API requests and Next.js server actions, enabling strict tenant-aware authorization and access control.
- Clerk’s React hooks (e.g., `useUser()`) provide easy access to current authenticated user info and claims on the frontend.

---

## 2. User-Tenant Association & Syncing

- On user login or signup, backend synchronizes Clerk user data with the Supabase `users` table, associating users with their `tenant_id` and role.

- User record fields include:

  | Field                      | Description                             |
  | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | `id`                       | UUID primary key                        |
  | `tenant_id`                | UUID foreign key to tenant              |
  | `clerk_id`                 | Clerk user identifier                   |
  | `email`                    | User email                              |
  | `role`                     | Tenant-scoped role (user, agent, admin) |
  | `created_at`, `updated_at` | Timestamps                              |

- Tenant assignment happens either during onboarding or via tenant admin management.

- This strict one-to-one user-to-tenant mapping enforces tenant isolation throughout.

---

## 3. Tenant-Aware JWT Tokens & Claims

- JWT tokens include critical claims:

```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",
  "tenant_id": "tenant-uuid",
  "role": "agent",
  "iat": 1622547800,
  "exp": 1622551400
}
```

- These claims are used by backend APIs and Supabase RLS policies to enforce tenant data isolation and role-based access control.
- Token validation ensures no cross-tenant or unauthorized access.

---

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Define tenant-scoped roles with clear permissions:

| Role            | Permissions                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**        | Create tickets, view and respond to own tickets only |
| **Agent**       | Manage tickets assigned within their tenant/team     |
| **Admin**       | Manage users, teams, tickets within their tenant     |
| **Super Admin** | (Optional) Full system-wide access across tenants    |

- RBAC is enforced on both backend (API, RLS policies) and frontend (conditional rendering and UI controls).

---

## 5. Frontend Session and State Management

- Use Clerk’s React hooks (`useUser()`) to retrieve authenticated user data, including tenant ID and role.
- Store tenant and user metadata reactively in **Zustand** global state scoped to the user session.
- Include the JWT token in all API calls to preserve tenant context.
- Tenant-aware state enables UI components to filter and display data accordingly.

---

## 6. Security Considerations

- Always verify JWT token signatures and expiration on backend.
- Reject requests where the tenant ID in the JWT does not match the resource tenant.
- Do not expose tenant or user IDs in logs or error messages.
- Use HTTPS and secure token storage in frontend.
- Employ short-lived tokens with refresh mechanisms for improved security.

---

## 7. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Integrate Clerk authentication UI components and React hooks.
- [ ] Sync Clerk users to Supabase `users` table with tenant IDs and roles.
- [ ] Issue JWT tokens embedding tenant ID and role claims.
- [ ] Enforce RBAC scoped to tenant on backend and frontend.
- [ ] Manage tenant-aware session state reactively with Zustand.
- [ ] Implement strict JWT validation and tenant authorization checks.

---

# DetailedDoc — Part 3: Tenant-Aware Data Modeling & State Management

---

## 1. Database Schema Design with Tenant Scope

- All tenant-specific tables must include a mandatory **`tenant_id` UUID** field to enforce strict tenant data isolation.
- This is critical for database-level enforcement and application logic consistency.

### Key Tables and Tenant Columns

| Table        | Important Columns                                                                                                   | Description                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `users`      | `id`, `tenant_id`, `clerk_id`, `email`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`                                          | Tenant-associated users        |
| `tickets`    | `id`, `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `subject`, `description`, `priority`, `category`, `status`, `deadline`, `assigned_to` | Tenant-scoped tickets          |
| `responses`  | `id`, `tenant_id`, `ticket_id`, `user_id`, `message`, `created_at`                                                  | Tenant-scoped ticket responses |
| `audit_logs` | `id`, `tenant_id`, `ticket_id`, `user_id`, `action_type`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `timestamp`                     | Tenant-scoped audit trail      |
| `teams`      | `id`, `tenant_id`, `name`, `members`                                                                                | Tenant-scoped support teams    |

---

## 2. Input Validation Using Zod

- Use **Zod** schemas to rigorously validate all incoming API data and requests.
- Enforce presence and correctness of `tenant_id` and other relevant fields to avoid cross-tenant data leaks.

Example ticket creation schema:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const createTicketSchema = z.object({
  tenant_id: z.string().uuid(),
  user_id: z.string().uuid(),
  subject: z.string().min(5),
  description: z.string().min(10),
  priority: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent']),
  category: z.string().optional(),
});
```

- Validate all inputs at API endpoints or server actions before processing.

---

## 3. Frontend State Management with Zustand

- Use **Zustand** for global state management scoped by the active tenant.
- Store tenant-aware slices for tickets, responses, users, and session data.

Example store setup:

```ts
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  tenant_id: null,
  tickets: [],
  responses: {},
  users: [],
  setTenant: (tenantId) => set({ tenant_id: tenantId }),
  setTickets: (tickets) => set({ tickets }),
  addResponse: (ticketId, response) =>
    set((state) => ({
      responses: {
        ...state.responses,
        [ticketId]: [...(state.responses[ticketId] || []), response],
      },
    })),
  setUsers: (users) => set({ users }),
}));
```

- This ensures that UI components only react to and render data belonging to the current tenant.

---

## 4. Dexie.js Persistent Cache Integration

- Use **Dexie.js** for persistent IndexedDB-based caching scoped per tenant.
- The local IndexedDB schema includes indexes on `tenant_id` and commonly queried fields (e.g., `status`, `priority`).
- On app load or navigation, **load data from Dexie first for instant UI rendering**.
- Sync incremental data changes with backend using delta queries and Supabase realtime subscriptions.
- Clear cache on logout or tenant switch to prevent data leakage.

---

## 5. Backend Data Access Patterns

- Backend API endpoints and server actions must:

  - Extract `tenant_id` from authenticated user JWT claims.
  - Include `tenant_id` as a mandatory filter in all SQL queries and mutations.
  - Reject requests where resource tenant and token tenant mismatch.

- Example SQL snippet filtering tickets by tenant:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tickets
WHERE tenant_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claim.tenant_id')::uuid;
```

- This ensures data security and tenant isolation at the database level.

---

## 6. Real-Time Updates with Supabase

- Supabase realtime channels push tenant-filtered data changes (insert/update/delete) to clients.
- Frontend subscribes only to updates for the current tenant.
- Realtime events update Zustand stores and Dexie caches immediately, keeping client state fresh.

---

## 7. Soft Delete Strategy

- Tickets are soft deleted by setting their status to `closed`.
- Closed tickets are hidden from normal UI views but retained for auditing and possible restoration.
- Responses and audit logs linked to these tickets remain for full history.

---

## 8. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Include `tenant_id` UUID columns in all tenant-scoped tables.
- [ ] Use Zod to validate tenant-aware input schemas strictly.
- [ ] Manage tenant-scoped frontend state via Zustand stores.
- [ ] Persist and query tenant-scoped data locally with Dexie.js.
- [ ] Enforce tenant filtering in backend queries and mutations.
- [ ] Subscribe to tenant-filtered realtime data from Supabase.
- [ ] Implement soft delete using ticket status flags.

---

# DetailedDoc — Part 4: Ticket Lifecycle & Status Management with Tenant Isolation

---

## 1. Ticket Status Definitions

Tickets progress through clearly defined statuses, strictly scoped within each tenant context:

| Status        | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New**       | Created and awaiting assignment within the tenant        |
| **Open**      | Actively being worked on by tenant’s support agents      |
| **Pending**   | Waiting on tenant user input or additional information   |
| **Resolved**  | Issue believed fixed, awaiting tenant user confirmation  |
| **Closed**    | Finalized and archived (soft deleted), no further action |
| **Escalated** | Requires urgent attention due to SLA breach or priority  |

---

## 2. Status Transitions & Business Rules

- Status changes are strictly **tenant-scoped** and validated with the tenant context from JWT.

- Typical lifecycle transitions:

  - `New → Open`: Agent picks up the ticket.
  - `Open → Pending`: Waiting on user info.
  - `Pending → Open`: User responds.
  - `Open → Resolved`: Agent marks as resolved.
  - `Resolved → Closed`: User confirms or times out.
  - Any status → `Escalated`: Triggered by SLA violation or urgent issues.

- Each status transition:

  - Triggers tenant-scoped audit logging.
  - Sends real-time updates via Supabase realtime.
  - Sends notifications scoped to tenant users as appropriate.

---

## 3. Soft Delete via Closed Status

- Soft delete implemented by setting ticket status to `Closed`.
- Closed tickets:

  - Are excluded from active views in the UI.
  - Remain stored in the database for audit and possible restoration.
  - Can be restored by tenant admins by changing status back to active.

---

## 4. Tenant-Aware Audit Logging

- Every lifecycle event (status changes, escalations, soft deletes) is recorded with tenant context:

| Field         | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `tenant_id`   | Tenant owning the ticket             |
| `ticket_id`   | Ticket affected                      |
| `user_id`     | User performing the action           |
| `action_type` | e.g., `status_change`, `soft_delete` |
| `old_value`   | Previous status                      |
| `new_value`   | New status                           |
| `timestamp`   | Time of change                       |

- Enables full traceability within tenant boundaries.

---

## 5. SLA Enforcement & Escalations

- Scheduled backend jobs (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions) monitor SLA deadlines per tenant.
- Overdue tickets automatically escalate status and priority, scoped per tenant.
- Notifications sent to relevant tenant users.
- Escalations are logged for audit purposes.

---

## 6. Role & Permission Controls

- Only authorized tenant users (agents, admins) can change ticket statuses.
- Backend APIs verify user roles and tenant ownership before allowing status updates.
- Unauthorized requests are rejected with appropriate error responses.

---

## 7. Frontend UI Considerations

- Tickets are grouped and filtered by status with clear badges and visual cues.
- UI actions depend on user role and tenant permissions.
- Real-time UI updates reflect lifecycle changes immediately.
- Confirmation dialogs and notifications improve user awareness.

---

## 8. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Define tenant-scoped ticket status enums including `Closed` for soft delete.
- [ ] Enforce all status transitions within tenant boundaries.
- [ ] Implement soft delete by status flag rather than physical deletion.
- [ ] Log lifecycle changes with tenant-aware audit entries.
- [ ] Automate SLA escalations and tenant notifications.
- [ ] Validate role-based permissions per tenant on all status updates.

---

# DetailedDoc — Part 5: Priority, Deadlines & Escalations with Tenant Isolation

---

## 1. Priority Levels

Each ticket has a priority level scoped to its tenant, indicating urgency and influencing SLA enforcement:

| Priority   | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Low**    | Minor issues; longer resolution time acceptable |
| **Medium** | Standard priority with typical SLA timelines    |
| **High**   | Requires quicker response and handling          |
| **Urgent** | Critical issues needing immediate attention     |

---

## 2. Setting Priorities

- Users select priority upon ticket creation.
- Tenant agents and admins can override priority to reflect real urgency.
- A default priority (typically Medium) is assigned if none specified.

---

## 3. Deadlines and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

- Each priority level corresponds to a tenant-scoped SLA deadline:

| Priority | SLA Deadline |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Urgent   | 4 hours      |
| High     | 1 day        |
| Medium   | 3 days       |
| Low      | 7 days       |

- Deadlines are set on ticket creation or when priority changes.

---

## 4. Automatic Priority Escalation

- Tenant-aware scheduled backend jobs (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions) periodically scan tickets against SLA deadlines.
- Tickets overdue for resolution automatically escalate to a higher priority within their tenant.
- Deadlines are reset based on the new priority’s SLA.
- Tenant support team members are notified of escalations.
- All escalations are logged with tenant context.

---

## 5. Manual Priority Management

- Tenant agents and admins can manually update ticket priorities via UI or API.
- Manual changes reset deadlines accordingly.
- All manual priority changes are recorded in tenant-scoped audit logs.

---

## 6. UI and Workflow Impact

- Tickets are sortable and filterable by priority and deadline in tenant views.
- Visual priority badges and countdown timers help agents prioritize workload.
- Escalation alerts keep teams proactive on SLA compliance.

---

## 7. Tenant-Aware Audit Logging

- All priority and deadline changes (automatic or manual) are logged with tenant ID, user, old and new values, and timestamps.

---

## 8. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Define tenant-scoped priority levels and associated SLAs.
- [ ] Implement tenant-aware automatic priority escalation jobs.
- [ ] Enable manual priority changes with tenant audit logging.
- [ ] Reflect priorities and escalations clearly in tenant-scoped UIs.
- [ ] Ensure notifications are tenant-specific.

---

# DetailedDoc — Part 6: Roles, Teams, Auditing & Monitoring with Tenant Isolation

---

## 1. User Roles and Permissions

- Define tenant-scoped roles governing what users can do within their tenant:

| Role              | Permissions                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**          | Create tickets, view/respond to own tickets only               |
| **Support Agent** | Manage tickets assigned to their tenant/team                   |
| **Admin**         | Manage users, teams, tickets, and settings within their tenant |
| **Super Admin**   | (Optional) Full system-wide access across tenants              |

- Roles are stored in the `users` table linked with tenant IDs.
- Role enforcement is implemented both backend (APIs, RLS policies) and frontend (UI controls).

---

## 2. Team Management

- Support agents are grouped into tenant-scoped teams or departments (e.g., Sales, Support).
- Teams have `tenant_id` for strict isolation.
- Tickets have an `assigned_to` field linked to users or teams within the tenant.
- Tenant admins can assign or reassign tickets to teams or users within their tenant scope.

---

## 3. Audit Logging

- Tenant-aware audit logs record critical actions such as:

  - Ticket status changes
  - Priority updates
  - User management actions
  - Ticket assignments

- Audit log entries contain:

  - `tenant_id` — tenant owning the action
  - `ticket_id` (if applicable)
  - `user_id` — user performing the action
  - `action_type`
  - `old_value` and `new_value`
  - `timestamp`

- Enables accountability and traceability within tenant boundaries.

---

## 4. Monitoring and Dashboards

- Tenant admins and super admins have access to dashboards presenting:

  - Ticket volume and status distributions
  - Assignment and resolution metrics
  - SLA compliance and escalation trends
  - Audit log summaries filtered by tenant

- Dashboards facilitate identifying bottlenecks and tracking team performance.

---

## 5. Optional Approval Workflows

- Implement tenant-scoped approval workflows for sensitive actions such as priority escalations:

  - Agents submit change requests.
  - Tenant admins or super admins review and approve/reject.
  - All approval activities are logged for transparency.

---

## 6. Integration with Clerk and Supabase

- Clerk manages tenant-aware user roles and groups.
- Supabase RLS policies enforce role and tenant-based data access control.
- Synchronization between Clerk and Supabase ensures role information is up-to-date and consistent.

---

## 7. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Define tenant-scoped user roles and permissions.
- [ ] Model tenant-scoped teams and manage ticket assignments accordingly.
- [ ] Maintain tenant-aware audit logging for critical actions.
- [ ] Build tenant-specific monitoring dashboards.
- [ ] Optionally implement tenant-scoped approval workflows.
- [ ] Sync Clerk user roles and groups with Supabase access controls.

---

# DetailedDoc — Part 7: Final Wrap-up and Best Practices

---

## 1. Summary of Tenant-Aware Architecture

- Your ticketing system is a **Domain-Driven Modular Monolith** that supports **true multi-tenancy**.
- Tenant isolation is enforced at **every layer**: frontend, backend, database (via Supabase RLS), and authentication (Clerk JWT claims).
- The system combines **hybrid client caching** (Dexie.js), **real-time updates** (Supabase realtime), and **optimistic UI** (Zustand) to deliver fast and responsive experiences.
- Soft deletes preserve data integrity and auditability.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and team management ensure proper permission enforcement.
