## 4. Tenant Isolation & Security

- **Tenant ID (`tenant_id`)** is mandatory and enforced on all key tables (users, tickets, responses, audit logs).
- Supabase **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies enforce tenant-based data filtering using JWT claims issued by Clerk.
- Backend API and server actions validate tenant context in JWT for every request, rejecting cross-tenant access.
- Soft deletes use status flags (e.g., `closed`) to preserve auditability and allow restoration.

---

## 5. Hybrid Data Sync & State Management Strategy

- **Local First:** Load filtered and paginated data instantly from Dexie.js cache on app start or user navigation.
- **Realtime Updates:** Subscribe to Supabase realtime channels scoped by tenant and roles for instant updates; update Zustand and Dexie immediately.
- **Server Fallback:** For queries or filters not fully satisfied by local cache, asynchronously fetch missing data pages from server.
- **Incremental Merge:** Merge server response data into Dexie and Zustand without blocking UI; update displayed data smoothly.
- **Optimistic UI:** Apply user changes instantly in Zustand and Dexie, sync with backend asynchronously, with rollback on failure.
- **Conflict Resolution:** On sync conflicts (e.g., offline edits), apply last-write-wins or tenant-defined rules and notify users if needed.
- **Cache Indexing:** Maintain Dexie indexes on tenant_id, status, priority for fast local queries.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Clear or refresh cache on logout, tenant switch, or schema changes to maintain integrity.

---

## 6. Advantages of this Enhanced Architecture

- **Ultra-Responsive UI:** Instant load from local cache plus real-time updates.
- **Offline-First:** User can operate without connectivity; sync occurs transparently on reconnect.
- **Bandwidth Efficient:** Minimized server fetches via realtime incremental updates and delta sync.
- **Secure & Tenant-Isolated:** RLS policies and token validation guard data access.
- **Scalable & Maintainable:** Clear separation of concerns and modular tech stack.
- **Extensible:** Designed for future AI integration, notifications, and approval workflows.

---

## 7. Next Steps

- Implement detailed Zod validation schemas.
- Define Supabase RLS policies for strict tenant and role enforcement.
- Build Zustand store with tenant-scoped slices and middleware for cache persistence.
- Setup Dexie.js schema with indexes and sync logic.
- Integrate Supabase realtime subscriptions with client cache.
- Implement server API endpoints and Next.js Server Actions with tenant-aware query logic.
- Establish robust conflict resolution and offline sync handling.

---

# Part 2: Authentication & Tenant-Aware User Management

---

## 1. Authentication with Clerk

- Use **Clerk** to handle all user authentication flows: sign-up, sign-in, session management, password reset, and identity verification.
- Clerk issues **JWT tokens** embedding essential claims including `user_id`, `tenant_id`, and `role` to establish the user's tenant context and permissions.
- JWT tokens are sent with every backend API call or Next.js server action to ensure **tenant-aware authorization** and **session validation**.
- Clerk's React hooks (e.g., `useUser()`) provide easy access to authenticated user info and claims in frontend components.

---

## 2. User-Tenant Association & Syncing

- On first login or signup, sync Clerk user data into the `users` table in Supabase to maintain tenant-aware user records:

  | Field        | Description                             |
  | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
  | `id`         | UUID primary key (internal user id)     |
  | `tenant_id`  | UUID referencing tenant                 |
  | `clerk_id`   | Clerk user ID (external auth ID)        |
  | `email`      | User email                              |
  | `role`       | Role within tenant (user, agent, admin) |
  | `created_at` | Timestamp                               |
  | `updated_at` | Timestamp                               |

- Tenant assignment can occur during onboarding or be managed by tenant admins.

- This ensures **strict one-to-one user-to-tenant association** for isolation and access control.

---

## 3. Tenant-Aware JWT Tokens

- JWT tokens issued by Clerk embed claims critical for tenant-aware access control:

  ```json
  {
    "sub": "user-uuid",
    "tenant_id": "tenant-uuid",
    "role": "agent",
    "iat": 1622547800,
    "exp": 1622551400
  }
  ```

- Backend services extract these claims to:

  - Enforce **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in Supabase.
  - Authorize API calls and business logic with tenant and role context.
  - Reject any cross-tenant or unauthorized access attempts.

---

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Define tenant-scoped roles with specific permissions:

| Role            | Permissions                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**        | Create tickets, view and respond to own tickets only |
| **Agent**       | Manage tickets assigned to their tenant/team         |
| **Admin**       | Manage users, teams, tickets within their tenant     |
| **Super Admin** | (Optional) Full system-wide access across tenants    |

- RBAC is enforced at multiple layers:

  - **Backend:** API endpoints, server actions, and Supabase RLS policies.
  - **Frontend:** Conditional UI rendering and feature gating based on user role.

---

## 5. Frontend Session and State Management

- Use Clerk React hooks (`useUser()`) to retrieve authenticated user data and tenant-aware claims.
- Store the user's `tenant_id`, `role`, and metadata in **Zustand** global state scoped to the session for reactive state management.
- All API calls from the frontend include the user's JWT token for maintaining tenant context.
- Tenant-aware state enables UI components to filter and display only relevant data.

---

## 6. Security Considerations

- Always verify JWT signature and expiration on backend services.
- Reject any request where the `tenant_id` claim in the token does not match the tenant context of the data being accessed or modified.
- Never expose tenant or user identifiers in logs, error messages, or any insecure contexts.
- Employ HTTPS and secure cookie storage for tokens.
- Use short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation for better security.

---

## 7. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Integrate Clerk authentication UI components and React hooks in the frontend.
- [ ] Sync Clerk users into Supabase users table with tenant associations on login/signup.
- [ ] Ensure JWT tokens embed tenant ID and role claims.
- [ ] Enforce tenant-scoped RBAC on backend APIs, Supabase RLS, and frontend.
- [ ] Manage tenant-aware session and user metadata reactively with Zustand.
- [ ] Implement strict JWT validation and tenant context authorization in server actions and APIs.
- [ ] Secure token handling with HTTPS, secure cookies, and token rotation.

---

# Part 3: Tenant-Aware Data Modeling & State Management

---

## 1. Database Schema Design with Tenant Scope

- All core database tables **must include a mandatory `tenant_id` UUID field** to enforce strict tenant data isolation.
- This tenant scoping is foundational to Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase and for maintaining clear data ownership.

### Key Tables and Fields

| Table        | Key Fields                                                                                                          | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `users`      | `id`, `tenant_id`, `clerk_id`, `email`, `role`, `created_at`, `updated_at`                                          | Tenant-associated users                    |
| `tickets`    | `id`, `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `subject`, `description`, `priority`, `category`, `status`, `deadline`, `assigned_to` | Tenant-scoped tickets                      |
| `responses`  | `id`, `tenant_id`, `ticket_id`, `user_id`, `message`, `created_at`                                                  | Tenant-scoped ticket conversation messages |
| `audit_logs` | `id`, `tenant_id`, `ticket_id`, `user_id`, `action_type`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `timestamp`                     | Tenant-scoped audit trail                  |

---

## 2. Input Validation Using Zod

- Use **Zod** schemas to validate all incoming API data.
- Require valid tenant IDs explicitly in the schemas to prevent cross-tenant data contamination.
- Example ticket creation schema:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const createTicketSchema = z.object({
  tenant_id: z.string().uuid(),
  user_id: z.string().uuid(),
  subject: z.string().min(5),
  description: z.string().min(10),
  priority: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent']),
  category: z.string().optional(),
});
```

- Validate all request payloads at the API or server action entry point to enforce tenant consistency and data integrity.

---

## 3. Frontend State Management with Zustand

- Use Zustand for **tenant-scoped global state management** holding tickets, responses, users, and session info.
- Example store setup:

```ts
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  tenant_id: null,
  tickets: [],
  responses: {},
  users: [],
  setTenant: (tenantId) => set({ tenant_id: tenantId }),
  setTickets: (tickets) => set({ tickets }),
  addResponse: (ticketId, response) =>
    set((state) => ({
      responses: {
        ...state.responses,
        [ticketId]: [...(state.responses[ticketId] || []), response],
      },
    })),
  setUsers: (users) => set({ users }),
}));
```

- This ensures UI components only react to and display data belonging to the current tenant, maintaining isolation on the client.

---

## 4. Dexie.js Persistent Cache Integration

- Use **Dexie.js** for persistent, tenant-scoped local caching of tickets, responses, and user data.
- IndexedDB schema should include indexes on `tenant_id` and other commonly filtered fields for fast local queries.
- On app start or navigation, **load data from Dexie first for instant UI rendering**.
- Sync delta updates with backend via incremental fetches and Supabase Realtime updates.
- Clear or reset cache on logout or tenant change to avoid data leaks.

---

## 5. Backend Data Access Patterns

- All backend database queries and mutations **filter by the tenant ID extracted from authenticated user JWTs**.
- Server actions and APIs reject any operation if the resource’s `tenant_id` does not match the token's tenant claim.
- Example SQL query filtering tickets by tenant:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tickets
WHERE tenant_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claim.tenant_id')::uuid;
```

- This pattern guarantees tenant data isolation at the database layer using PostgreSQL RLS policies.

---

## 6. Real-Time Updates with Supabase

- Utilize Supabase realtime channels to **push tenant-filtered data updates** (inserts, updates, deletes).
- Frontend subscribes only to data relevant to the current tenant and user role.
- Realtime events update Zustand and Dexie caches immediately, keeping client state fresh.

---

## 7. Soft Delete Strategy

- Implement soft delete by changing ticket status to `closed` instead of physical deletion.
- Closed tickets remain accessible for audits and potential restoration.
- Frontend filters out closed tickets from active views but can show them in archival views.

---

## 8. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Define `tenant_id` UUID on all key tables and enforce this via database schema.
- [ ] Validate tenant-aware input using Zod schemas.
- [ ] Manage tenant-scoped global state with Zustand.
- [ ] Implement Dexie.js persistent cache with tenant scoping and delta sync.
- [ ] Enforce tenant filtering on backend queries and mutations strictly.
- [ ] Subscribe to tenant-scoped realtime data updates from Supabase.
- [ ] Use soft delete via status flags instead of hard deletes.

---

# Part 4: Ticket Lifecycle & Status Management with Tenant Isolation

---

## 1. Ticket Status Definitions

Tickets progress through a well-defined set of statuses scoped within each tenant context to reflect their lifecycle and current state:

| Status        | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New**       | Ticket created, awaiting assignment within tenant        |
| **Open**      | Actively worked on by tenant’s support agents            |
| **Pending**   | Waiting on tenant user input or additional information   |
| **Resolved**  | Issue believed fixed; awaiting tenant user confirmation  |
| **Closed**    | Finalized and archived (soft deleted), no further action |
| **Escalated** | Urgent; requires immediate attention due to SLA breach   |

---

## 2. Status Transitions & Business Rules

- Status changes are **strictly tenant-scoped**, validated using the tenant context from the JWT.

- Typical lifecycle transitions:

  - `New → Open`: Agent picks up ticket for work.
  - `Open → Pending`: Waiting on user input or info.
  - `Pending → Open`: User responds; ticket becomes active again.
  - `Open → Resolved`: Agent marks issue as fixed.
  - `Resolved → Closed`: User confirms resolution or timeout occurs.
  - Any status → `Escalated`: Triggered by SLA violations or urgent issues.

- Each transition triggers:

  - Tenant-aware audit logging.
  - Real-time UI updates scoped by tenant via Supabase realtime.
  - Notifications as needed.

---

## 3. Soft Delete via Closed Status

- **Soft delete** is implemented by setting the ticket status to `Closed`.
- Closed tickets are:

  - Hidden from active ticket views in the UI.
  - Retained in the database for audit, compliance, and potential restoration.

- Restoration workflows change status back to active states (`Open`, `Pending`, etc.).

---

## 4. Tenant-Aware Audit Logging

- All lifecycle actions (status changes, escalations, soft deletes) are recorded in an **audit log** with:

  - `tenant_id` (tenant context)
  - `ticket_id`
  - `user_id` (actor performing the action)
  - `action_type` (e.g., status_update, escalation)
  - `old_value` and `new_value` for transparency
  - `timestamp`

- Audit logs ensure accountability and traceability scoped by tenant.

---

## 5. SLA Enforcement & Escalations

- SLA deadlines and priority levels are monitored per tenant using scheduled backend jobs (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions).
- Tickets past their SLA deadline automatically escalate status and priority within their tenant scope.
- Tenant users are notified of escalations via in-app notifications or email.
- Escalation actions are recorded in audit logs.

---

## 6. Role & Permission Controls

- Only authorized tenant users (agents, admins) can change ticket statuses.
- Backend APIs and server actions **validate tenant ownership and user role** before allowing status updates.
- Unauthorized attempts are rejected with appropriate errors.

---

## 7. Frontend UI Considerations

- Tickets are grouped and filtered by status in the UI with clear badges and visual indicators.
- UI actions available depend on the current user's role and tenant permissions.
- Real-time updates immediately reflect status changes.
- Confirmation dialogs and notifications provide user feedback for lifecycle transitions.

---

## 8. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Define tenant-scoped ticket status enums in backend and frontend.
- [ ] Enforce all status transitions within tenant boundaries.
- [ ] Use soft delete pattern via status flags; no physical deletion.
- [ ] Log all lifecycle changes with tenant-aware audit entries.
- [ ] Automate SLA escalations tenant-wise with notifications.
- [ ] Validate role-based permissions per tenant for all status updates.

---

# Part 5: Priority, Deadlines & Escalations with Tenant Isolation

---

## 1. Priority Levels

Each ticket has a priority level representing its urgency, scoped within the tenant to prioritize support workflows effectively:

| Priority   | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low**    | Minor issues; longer resolution times acceptable  |
| **Medium** | Standard priority with typical SLA response times |
| **High**   | Requires quicker attention and resolution         |
| **Urgent** | Critical issues needing immediate action          |

---

## 2. Setting Priorities

- Users select a priority level when creating tickets.
- Tenant agents and admins can override or update priorities to reflect actual urgency.
- If unspecified, a sensible default priority (typically Medium) is assigned automatically.

---

## 3. Deadlines and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

- Each priority level has an associated SLA deadline defining the expected resolution timeframe, for example:

| Priority | SLA Deadline |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Urgent   | 4 hours      |
| High     | 1 day        |
| Medium   | 3 days       |
| Low      | 7 days       |

- Deadlines are set upon ticket creation or when priorities are changed.

---

## 4. Automatic Priority Escalation

- Tenant-aware scheduled backend jobs (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions) periodically check tickets against their SLA deadlines.
- Tickets past their deadline automatically escalate priority by one level within the tenant’s scope (e.g., Medium → High).
- Deadlines reset according to the new priority’s SLA.
- Notifications are sent to the tenant’s support team members about escalations.
- All priority escalations are logged with tenant context for auditing.

---

## 5. Manual Priority Management

- Tenant agents and admins can manually update ticket priorities at any time via UI or API.
- Manual priority changes reset the associated SLA deadlines accordingly.
- Each manual change is recorded in the tenant-scoped audit logs for traceability.

---

## 6. UI and Workflow Impact

- Tickets are sortable and filterable by priority and urgency in tenant-scoped views.
- Visual priority badges, countdown timers, or escalation alerts assist agents in prioritizing workload effectively.
- Notifications and alerts keep support teams proactive about upcoming or missed SLAs.

---

## 7. Tenant-Aware Audit Logging

- All priority and deadline changes (automatic or manual) are captured in audit logs including:

  - Tenant ID
  - User who made the change
  - Old and new priority values
  - Timestamps

---

## 8. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Define tenant-scoped priority levels and SLA deadlines.
- [ ] Implement tenant-aware automatic priority escalation jobs.
- [ ] Enable manual priority updates with tenant-scoped audit logging.
- [ ] Reflect priorities and escalation status clearly in tenant UIs.
- [ ] Ensure notifications target tenant-specific users only.

---

# Part 6: Roles, Teams, Auditing & Monitoring with Tenant Isolation

---

## 1. User Roles and Permissions

- Roles define the capabilities of users within their tenant context:

| Role              | Permissions                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**          | Create tickets, view/respond only to their own tickets              |
| **Support Agent** | Manage and update tickets assigned to their tenant or team          |
| **Admin**         | Manage users, teams, tickets, and configuration within their tenant |
| **Super Admin**   | (Optional) Full system-wide access across all tenants               |

- Roles are stored with tenant association in the `users` table.
- Enforcement of roles happens on the backend (API, RLS) and frontend (UI controls).

---

## 2. Team Management

- Support agents are grouped into **teams or departments** scoped by tenant (e.g., Sales, Support).
- Teams include a `tenant_id` field for strict isolation.
- Tickets have an `assigned_to` field linked to individual users or teams within the tenant.
- Tenant admins can assign or reassign tickets to teams or users within their boundaries.

---

## 3. Audit Logging

- Audit logs track critical actions such as:

  - Ticket status changes
  - Priority updates
  - User management (creation, role changes)
  - Ticket assignments

- Audit entries include:

  - `tenant_id` — tenant context
  - `ticket_id` (where applicable)
  - `user_id` — the actor performing the action
  - `action_type`
  - `old_value` and `new_value`
  - `timestamp`

- Audit logging ensures traceability and accountability scoped per tenant.

---

## 4. Monitoring and Dashboards

- Tenant admins and super admins access dashboards displaying:

  - Ticket volumes by status and priority
  - Assignment and resolution metrics
  - SLA compliance and escalation trends
  - Audit log summaries filtered by tenant

- Dashboards aid in identifying bottlenecks and monitoring team performance.

## 5. Optional Approval Workflows

- Sensitive actions (e.g., priority escalations) may trigger tenant-scoped approval workflows:

  - Agents submit change requests.
  - Tenant admins or super admins review and approve or reject.
  - All approval-related actions are logged for transparency.

- Clerk manages user roles and groups including tenant context.
- Supabase RLS enforces data access control based on tenant and role.
- Synchronization between Clerk and Supabase ensures up-to-date role and team information.
