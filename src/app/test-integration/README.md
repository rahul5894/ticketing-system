# Integration Test Page

This test page verifies the complete integration between Clerk authentication, Supabase database, and real-time subscriptions using the latest 2025+ patterns.

## Features Tested

### 1. JWT Token Verification
- ✅ Displays raw JWT token from Clerk
- ✅ Shows decoded JWT payload with tenant information
- ✅ Provides copy button for manual verification on jwt.io
- ✅ Displays current user information from Clerk session

### 2. Supabase Connection Test
- ✅ Tests basic database connectivity
- ✅ Measures response times
- ✅ Verifies tenant data retrieval
- ✅ Confirms tenant isolation is working
- ✅ Shows initial tickets count

### 3. Real-time Subscription Test
- ✅ Tests Supabase real-time WebSocket connection
- ✅ Creates test tickets with optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Displays live ticket list that updates in real-time
- ✅ Shows real-time events log
- ✅ Includes connection status monitoring
- ✅ Implements error handling and reconnection logic

## Modern 2025+ Patterns Used

### React 19.1.0 Features
- **useOptimistic Hook**: For immediate UI updates while waiting for server confirmation
- **Server Components**: Initial data fetching on the server for optimal performance
- **Client Components**: Real-time subscription management in browser environment

### Next.js 15.3.4 Features
- **App Router**: Modern routing with server/client component separation
- **Server Actions**: Form handling with progressive enhancement
- **Streaming**: Progressive loading with proper loading states

### Clerk Authentication
- **High-level Abstractions**: Using `auth()` and `useAuth()` instead of manual JWT handling
- **Automatic Token Management**: Clerk handles token refresh and validation
- **Tenant-aware Claims**: JWT tokens include tenant_id for multi-tenant isolation

### Supabase Real-time
- **Granular Subscriptions**: Filtering by tenant_id for security
- **Connection Status Monitoring**: Real-time connection health tracking
- **Optimized Performance**: Minimal complexity with maximum efficiency

## Usage

1. Navigate to `/test-integration` while authenticated
2. The page will automatically test all integrations
3. Check the status indicators for each test section
4. Create test tickets to verify real-time functionality
5. Monitor the events log for real-time updates

## Test Results

The page provides a comprehensive summary showing:
- ✅ JWT Token Verification status
- ✅ Database Connection status  
- ✅ Real-time Subscriptions status
- ✅ Tenant Isolation verification

## Cleanup

This test page is self-contained and can be safely deleted by removing:
- `/src/app/test-integration/` directory
- Any test tickets created during testing (marked with "TEST:" prefix)

## Security Notes

- All JWT tokens are handled securely using Clerk's abstractions
- Tenant isolation is enforced at the database level via RLS policies
- Real-time subscriptions are filtered by tenant_id
- No sensitive data is exposed in the client-side code

## Performance Considerations

- Initial data is fetched server-side for optimal loading
- Real-time subscriptions use minimal bandwidth
- Optimistic updates provide immediate user feedback
- Connection status is monitored for reliability
